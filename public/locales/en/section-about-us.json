    "text": "A non-profit charitable organization that implements simple and understandable projects — helps elderly people, disabled people, children's rehabilitation centers, animals, low-income families, internally displaced persons, and residents of cities in the East and South of the country affected by hostilities to survive terrible wartime. Our help is primarily received by the most vulnerable and at the same time defenseless layers of the population. We provide them with food, medicine, clothing, and hygiene products free of charge. We work purposefully, that is, we send or deliver necessary items personally to the address. We know for sure that all Ukrainians want to help their country and bring victory closer. We are also confident that countless people around the world are ready to support Ukraine. And we know how to do it. Our goal is to save human lives, but we cannot achieve it without your help."
