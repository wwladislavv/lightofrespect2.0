    "story": "As a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukrainian territory on February 24th, thousands of people died, and dozens of cities were destroyed. Russian soldiers destroy everything in their path: they rape women, men, and children, loot their property, and simply kill civilians. Over 2,500,000 people have left their homes in search of peace. They have lost their jobs, roofs over their heads, relatives, or entire families.<br/> <br/> This project was created by volunteers for humanitarian aid, which is necessary for many people every day. We receive dozens of requests every day: we purchase products, personal hygiene items, medicines, and food for pets. Our mission is to make life easier for those in need, for those who suffer the most from this terrible war."
